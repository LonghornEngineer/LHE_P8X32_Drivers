**Driver for the WS2801 3-Channel RGB LED Driver**  

The WS2801 is a 3-channel constant current LED drivers that is designed for controlling chains of RGB LEDs. 
The IC is controlled by a 2-wire serial control scheme that allows multiple WS2801 to be chained together. 
You can find the WS2801 in the link below. This demo code basically shifts out 24 bits (8bits per color) using a 2-wire protocol. 
This code only works for one WS2801.
Multiple (daisy chained) WS2801 is not implemented yet.
